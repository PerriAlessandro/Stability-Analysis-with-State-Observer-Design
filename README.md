# Stability-Analysis-with-State-Observer-Design
This repository contains the solution to an assignment located in the "Assignment.pdf" file. The tasks of the assignment are:

- Write the state equations of the system
- Determine the stationary state-feedback control law
- Check whether this control law ensures that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable
- Design an asymptotic observer of the state
- Build the overall model of the system by SIMULINK and analyze the behavior of the system
- Determine the closed-loop transfer function T(s)=Y(s)/R(s) and analyze the frequency response.

The report of the solution is available in "Report.pdf". The Simulink Model of the overall system can be found in "sml_model.slx" and the Matlab code used in the analysis is in "matlab_code.m".

## Author
This repository was created by Alessandro Perri.

## Usage
To reproduce the results of the analysis, you can follow the steps described in the report and execute the code in "matlab_code.m". The Simulink Model can also be used to visualize the system behavior and test different input signals.

## Note
For more details about the assignment and the solution, please refer to the "Report.pdf" file.
